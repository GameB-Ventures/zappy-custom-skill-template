# Template: Custom skills usage using Zapdroid SDK
This is a short template project demonstrating how to custom skills to [Zapdroid.io](https://www.zapdroid.io) chatbot using [Zapdroid SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zapdroid-sdk), and then calling it with natural language. 

## LLM limitations

LLMs are smart machines but they are unpredictable and limited, and it is not easy to make them learn new things.

#### Case in point: 

![specs](before.png "they cannot even generate a random number")

They cannot even generate a random number.


## Requirements
You should already have Zapdroid installed on your slack workspace or any other supported platform.

Make sure to have following environment variables:
```
ZAPDROID_TEAM_ID=TXXXXX-YYYYYYYYYY
ZAPDROID_SECRET_KEY=ZZZZZZZZZ
```

You can get these by asking Zapdroid on your slack. In a secure channel ask 'what are my SDK credentials?'

Put these into .env file

    mv .env.tmpl .env

## Usage
Refer to index.js to see how to use createSkill() 

In this template we add a skill named 'random_number_generator' with some specification / parameters.
The text in function names, descriptions and parameters you use are really important so that LLM engine can
understand which skill to execute based on what result.

And then send it back to the chatbot interface (Slack, WhatsApp, Discord) with reply()

## Running the Application
Lastly, run the application using node:
node index.js

You should see something like this:


    $ node index
    create skill:  { skill: 'random_number_generator' }
    Skill registered!


## Testing

Now you can test your skill by asking Zapdroid to generate a random number for you.

Please note: It will automatically match the skill to execute using natural language and also parse the arguments. Sometimes, it can make up arguments itself, so be warned to explicitly add a validation layer to avoid unexpected results.
